# Data-Driven Optimization of EV Sales Funnel, Financial Qualification, and Customer Experience (NPS)

## Project Overview

This repository contains the complete analytical framework, key insights, and strategic recommendations developed for optimizing an electric vehicle (EV) sales cycle. This comprehensive **data science project** involved a rigorous, holistic analysis across three critical operational pillars:

1.  **Lead-to-Delivery Funnel Analysis:** Identifying process efficiency, conversion rates, and time-based bottlenecks (Turnaround Time or TAT).
2.  **Cancellation Root Cause Analysis:** Pinpointing financial and operational drivers of customer attrition to reduce churn.
3.  **Customer Experience (NPS) Benchmarking:** Evaluating store-level satisfaction and performance metrics to drive service improvements.

The outcome is a detailed performance dashboard and a set of actionable strategies designed to resolve major operational gaps, improve financial qualification rigor, and significantly boost customer satisfaction and loyalty.

## Core Analytical Pillars & Key Insights

The analysis was structured to provide a 360-degree view of the sales and post-sales processes:

### 1. Sales Funnel & Operational Analysis
| Metric | Insight | Impact |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Operational Gap** | **18.8% (188 leads)** are stalled in the pipeline without an assigned delivery date. | This high-risk backlog severely affects the customer experience and puts potential revenue at risk of cancellation. |
| **Bottleneck Location** | The stall is not company-wide; it is primarily concentrated in two key cities (Bangalore and Delhi). | Indicates a localized process failure requiring targeted intervention and **Turnaround Time (TAT)** reduction. |

### 2. Cancellation & Financial Qualification Analysis
| Metric | Insight | Impact |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Cancellation Driver**| Nearly half of all cancellations (**44.3%**) are driven by **"Price"** and **"Financing Issue"** concerns. | This exposes a failure in the initial financial pre-qualification process, leading to unnecessary effort on high-risk leads. |

### 3. Customer Experience (NPS) & Benchmarking
| Metric | Insight | Impact |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Worst Performer** | One major city (Mumbai) was identified as the worst-performing location, with **48.24%** of its customers classified as **Detractors**. | Requires immediate management intervention to address service failures and mitigate negative word-of-mouth. |
| **High-Value Leads**| Identified **303 "Hot" leads** that show the highest propensity to convert. | Strategies should be put in place to prioritize and fast-track service for these valuable customers. |

## Strategic Recommendations

The project culminated in a clear, high-impact action plan:

* **Financial Gatekeeping:** Implement stricter financial pre-qualification checks at the earliest stage of the lead process to proactively cut down on price and financing-driven cancellations.
* **Bottleneck Resolution Task Force:** Dedicate resources to clear the backlog of stalled leads in Bangalore and Delhi, focusing on improving process clarity and reducing TAT.
* **Proactive CX Management:** Launch a retention program where managers personally follow up with unhappy **Detractor** customers to address concerns and rebuild trust.
* **Enhance Service Excellence:** Establish a **24/7 helpdesk** and develop dedicated regional service hubs to provide quick, reliable solutions and reduce post-sales customer frustration.
